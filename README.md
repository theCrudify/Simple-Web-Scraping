# Simple Web Scraping
 This project implements a web scraper using Python and the undetected-chromedriver and selenium libraries. Its purpose is to automate the collection of data from Google search results, such as titles, descriptions, and links, based on a provided keyword. The collected data is then stored in a CSV file for further analysis.
